\section{Projects}
\subsection{Minor Project (Graduation Subject)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {RRP Configuration based manipulator}
    \item[]\textbf{Sep 2019 -- Dec 2019}
    \item[] \textbf{RRP Configuration based Robotic Manipulator for Drawing application.The manipulator was a 3-DOF planar manipulator and was able to draw basic shapes.It uses a Arduino microcontroller and three servo motors for providing joint actuation.}
    \item {Gesture Controlled Robotic car with Robotic Arm}
    \item[] \textbf{Feb 2019 -- May 2019 }
    \item[] \textbf{Hand Gesture controlled robotic car with embedded robotic arm. It comprises of two modules, one is the car and other is the robotic arm. The movements of the car and that of Arm was controlled by the gestures of the hand. The gestures of the hands was recognized via flex sensors and sent to the receiver module. The main components of the project was Arduino, Flex Sensor, IR transmitter and Receiver module, Robotic Arm, Robotic Car}
    \item {Smart Street-light System}
    \item[] \textbf{Sep 2018 -- Dec 2018}
    \item[] \textbf{A Project to demonstrate the energy saving model by turning ON the lights only when it is needed. The working of the system was that the highway streetlight will be turned ON only when the vehicle comes. It uses different sensors to detect the vehicle and the microcontroller sends the signal to Turn ON subsequent lights.}

\subsection{ Personal Projects}
\begin{itemize}
\item {Face-Recognition based Attendance System}
    \item[] \textbf{Oct 2019 -- Nov 2019}
    \item[] \textbf{Project programmed in Python Programming language which Detects and recognize  people from a live video and mark them present in that particular lecture. The dataset used in this project was the photos of the classmates and were trained in the model for face recognition.}
    \item[] Accuracy : 92\%
\item {Arduino Based Environment Thermometer}
\item[] \textbf{Sep 2019}
\item[] \textbf{Arduino Based Environment Thermometer which senses the Temperature and Humidity of the surrounding environment. It uses a Arduino Microcontroller, DHT-11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to sense the temperature and humidity and a 16X2 LCD display to show the output to the user.}
\end{itemize}
